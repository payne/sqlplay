# Spring Boot & Hello SQL

1. http://start.spring.io/
   1. docs/screenshots/ shows the options I choose
1. `./gradlew bootRun` works
1. http://localhost:8080/index.html serves src/main/resources/static/index.html 
1. http://localhost:8080 or http://localhost:8080/browser/index.html goes to the HAL Browser
1. http://localhost:8080/h2-console goes to the H2 database console; just click login.
   1. Be sure to use the JDBC URL jdbc:h2:mem:testdb
   1. Copy from http://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_create_table.asp (which has a nice try it yourself feature!)
~~~~~
CREATE TABLE Persons
(
PersonID int,
LastName varchar(255),
FirstName varchar(255),
Address varchar(255),
City varchar(255)
);
~~~~~
  1. Then insert a row...
~~~~~
insert into persons values (1,'Payne','Matt','72nd & Dodge','Omaha');
~~~~~
  1. Then see what is there...
~~~~~
select * from persons;
~~~~~  
1. Notice that http://localhost:8080/member?id=42 works because of MemberController
1. Also notice that one can enter member into the HAL browser's search box.  Since I am not yet, doing things properly (still just faffing about half assed learning) it's not HAL compliant.
1. Into Eclipse!
  1. `./gradlew eclipse`
  1. Import the project into eclipse
  1. /Users/mpayne/Study2/Java/Spring/SQL/sqlplay is where the project is on Matt's laptop.  And Matt uses the neon distribution of eclipse for this.


## Background
1. It would be great to be able to demo in JPA and JDBC all of the concepts covered by http://www.sohamkamani.com/blog/2016/07/07/a-beginners-guide-to-sql/
1. Spring Boot 101 (Part 3) database access

1. Get the stuff from https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/tree/master/spring-boot-samples/spring-boot-sample-web-jsp working
